# 🏥 NirogGyan - Healthcare Appointment Booking (Frontend Only)

This is a responsive frontend application built with **React.js**, designed to allow users to view available doctors, check their availability, and book appointments. This submission covers only the frontend part using static data without any backend/server.

## 📌 Objective

To create a simple and clean user interface for booking appointments with doctors, fulfilling the following features:

- Doctor list with search functionality
- Doctor profile view with details and availability
- Simple form to book an appointment

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack Used

- **React.js** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **JavaScript** (No TypeScript)
- **React Router DOM** – for client-side routing
- **CSS** – for basic styling
- **Static JSON data** – used in place of a real backend

## ✨ Improvements with More Time

- Implement a real backend using **Node.js/Express**
- Store appointment data in a database (e.g., MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- Add user authentication (Login/Signup)
- Email confirmation for appointments
- Form validation using Formik or React Hook Form
- UI enhancements using **Tailwind CSS** or Material UI

---

## 🧱 Challenges Faced
